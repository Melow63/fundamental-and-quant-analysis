# Fundamental & Quantitative Analysis

This repository contains my first practical explorations in **financial analysis using Python**, starting with an automated script for stock fundamental analysis.

The goal is to progressively build tools that combine **fundamental valuation**, **quantitative indicators**, and eventually **basic algorithmic trading concepts** as I learn.

## Fundamental Analysis Script

**File:** `Fundamental analysis.py`  
**Language:** Python  
**Libraries:** `yfinance`, `pandas`, `numpy`

This script retrieves financial data for a stock (from Yahoo Finance) and computes:

- Price-to-Earnings (P/E)  
- Price-to-Book (P/B)  
- Return on Equity (ROE)  
- Return on Assets (ROA)  
- Free Cash Flow  
- Revenue & earnings growth  
- A custom **investment score (0–20)**  
- A simple **buy/hold/sell interpretation**

The goal is to create a clean and readable tool for quick fundamental screening of a company.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in:

- financial data analysis  
- Python for finance  
- quantitative and algorithmic trading concepts  

I will progressively add more scripts, notebooks, and models as I deepen my understanding of both **fundamental** and **quantitative** approaches.

This repository also supports my academic work and prepares me for roles involving financial analysis, trading support, and quantitative methods in a professional environment.

## Next Steps

- Add a version that analyzes **multiple tickers**  
- Build visual charts for ratios and growth metrics  
- Introduce simple **quantitative indicators** (RSI, MACD, volatility)  
- Develop a multi-step environment for future **RL trading experiments**
